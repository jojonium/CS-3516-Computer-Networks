## Project 3

Project 3 is an implementation of a distributed asynchronous distance vector
routing protocol in C. For the assignment I was provided with a network emulator
and wrote the functions for each node to implement a distance vector routing
algorithm to find shortest paths to all other nodes.

The implementation works for any number of nodes (up to MAX_NODES = 10) in any
configuration. The default configuration is shown below, but this can be changed
in the "NodeConfigurationFile".
