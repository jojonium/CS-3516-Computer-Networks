CS 3516 - Computer Networks
===========================

Coursework and assignments for the WPI computer science class CS 3516 - Computer Networks.

## Lab 1

The purpose of lab 1 is to get students familiar with the Wireshark packet capture tool. I used this
program to capture and analyze internet packets from my home network. With Wireshark running I
visited a website in a browser, then looked at the types of packets that were sent to and from my
computer. "lab1-get.pdf" and "lab1-ok.pdf" show the two main HTML packets involved, a GET request
from my computer and a 200 OK response from the server. The folder also includes a "pcapng" file that
shows the results of Wireshark during the lab.
